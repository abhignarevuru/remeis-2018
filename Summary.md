## Astronomical object classification - How can I automate it?

I did a summer research internship at the Dr. Karl Remeis Observatory in Bamberg, Germany under the supervision of Prof. JÃ¶rn Wilms from 15th May to 12th July 2018. My student mentor, Kunal Deoskar, who had worked with Joern on a previous project, recommended that his group would be a good fit for me. Joern was interested in my work and offered some interesting projects I could work on based on my supplementary computing background and previous astronomy projects. I chose to work on the eROSITA project, an instrument on the Spektr-RG satellite which performs a deep space survey of the entire x-ray sky. Specifically, I am interested in the near-real time analysis of the satellite data in order to classify the observed sources in an automated fashion.

The customary way to process satellite sky survey data requires a good deal of human effort. In most cases, data from a new survey is verified by cross-matching with previously labelled objects.
